				<h3>Connect.  Align.  Act.</h3>

				<p>Kpipe.com is designed to be a One Stop Shop for services for both businesses and consumers. A broad range of Service Packages are available with defined outcomes for a fixed price. Each is delivered by very qualified individuals who are part of the growing Kpipe.com team..
				</p>
				<p>Getting things done in business is always difficult. Especially the small focused efforts. Kpipe addresses that challenge. Our service packages lay out what you are buying and how much it will costs. Kpipe is your service solution company. We stand behind the service delivered. We are far more than a “match-making” company. We are your solution! We make certain the service package is delivered with the defined outcomes accomplished. If not, we have a money back guarantee. You won't get that on those match-making sites. 		
				</p>
				<p>We also have far more solutions. Service solutions that you can purchase today and get immediate action on. Our goal is to be a one stop shop for services. Everyday we will be getting closer to that goal. New services will continually be added. Stop back often!
